Hello and Namaste. I am Bhushan Luitel from the Eastern Nepal. Currently, I am final year BSc(Hons) Computing student of Itahari International COllege. I Love to play Basketball and is fascinated to Technology since Childhood.
Learning through out the training session was fruitfull. During the 2 days time i learnt a lot about Git and Git hub, i was only a beginner for Git and GIt hub, Me and my team were having the problems to complete the group work project in this pandamic. As sharing of document and files and editing of it was being messy. But now it will be helpfull for me and my team using Git hub for sharing the flies and branches can be created and one can work in the specific branch without editing the origional file.
